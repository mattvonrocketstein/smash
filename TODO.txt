 bugfixes
----------

 broken 'git checkout<tab>' completion and e.g. "git checkout origin/master <tab>"

 plugins somehow honor 'requires' methods, requires is not moved into plugins.json either

 rehashx may need to reinstall aliases on a per-project basis

 when virtualenv changes, unalias all the old things

 plugin ideas
---------------
 rst-rewriter plugin
 apt-completer is already available-
   node/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/Extensions/ipy_completers.py

 also use the vcs_completer to implement the git completer..

 github plugin

 wmctrl integration for desktop switching, etc

 completer for "git add<tab>" (dont need fs if not rebase)
 completers for apt-get

 reddit

 multiple integrations along the lines of emacs .recentf,
 with and without project-manager


 had to do this many times. I remember a piece of code, a function name, a constant, a file, that was there. And now itâ€™s gone. What happened? In which commit was it removed? This trick rocks as you can search through the entire git diff history for a string. I warn you it might take some time:

git rev-list --all | (
    while read revision; do
        git grep -F 'Your search string' $revision
    done
)
