 bugfixes
----------

 --project= cli is broken

 broken 'git checkout<tab>' completion and e.g. "git checkout origin/master <tab>"

 plugins somehow honor 'requires' methods, requires is not moved into plugins.json either

 rehashx may need to reinstall aliases on a per-project basis

 when virtualenv changes, unalias all the old things

 plugin ideas
---------------

 completer for pip, if requirements.txt is in the working directory

 completer for "git add<tab>"

 completers for apt-get, python setup.py

 replace unix 'which' with a macro that first tries unix-which,
 then, if it fails, tries py.which (from pycmd library) etc

 reddit

 multiple integrations along the lines of emacs .recentf,
 with and without project-manager
