 bugfixes
----------

 plugins somehow honor 'requires' methods, requires is not moved into plugins.json either

 move .smash/smash/* --> .smash/

 rehashx may need to reinstall aliases on a per-project basis

 when virtualenv changes, unalias all the old things

 plugin ideas
---------------
 completers for apt-get, python setup.py

 replace unix 'which' with a macro that first tries unix-which,
 then, if it fails, tries py.which (from pycmd library) etc

 reddit

 multiple integrations along the lines of emacs .recentf,
 with and without project-manager
