 improvements
--------------
 use jsonschema
 completion based on history and ngrams
 reread aliases/bookmarks/etc constantly
 warn is a typo is introduced to conf, but dont die?

 bugfixes
----------
 ?? automatically translate "export foo=bar" style commands to use os.environ[]

 broken 'git checkout<tab>' completion and e.g. "git checkout origin/master <tab>"

 rehashx may need to reinstall aliases on a per-project basis

 when virtualenv changes, unalias all the old things

 plugin ideas
---------------
 plugins somehow honor 'requires' methods,
 requires is not moved into plugins.json either
 use spock csp

 automatically trigger rehash after things like setup.py, make install, etc

 project activation could open a file if emacs isn't already editing one..
 now, how to get a list of files currently being edited?

 rst-rewriter plugin

 apt-completer is already available-
   node/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/Extensions/ipy_completers.py

 ?? wmctrl integration for desktop switching, etc

 completer for "git add<tab>" (dont need fs if not rebase)
 use standard ipython completers for apt-get

 ?? reddit

 multiple integrations along the lines of emacs .recentf,
 with and without project-manager

 git plugin
-----------
 github plugin

 nice addition for the git-plugin:
