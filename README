=====
About
=====

Smash is the smart-shell, a python/bash hyrbid building on the pysh profile for IPython.

========
Features
========

Python/Bash chimera:
    in general, python vs system-commands are usually treated the way
    you would expect, using the principle of least astonishment.

Git VCS Integration:
    branch/filesystem completion for git VCS
    default prompt includes branch-name

Fabfile integration:
    tab-completion over fabfile commands
    programmatic access to the functions themselves

Abstraction for project-management:
    directories can be registered as projects
    project code can be searched
    project code does not necessarily need to be python, but
    if the project does contain python code, then:
        projects can be activated if they contain virtualenv
        projects can be watched for changes, then pyflaked

============
Requirements
============

    You need IPython==0.10, because smash uses the 'pysh' IPython profile, which
    does not seem to work in newer version of IPython. see also:
