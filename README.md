##What is it?

Smash is an attempt at writing a smarter shell.  [Python developers](http://mattvonrocketstein.github.io/smash/python_use_cases.html) will be particularly interested because it also happens to host a full-fledged python runtime (via IPython) and offers sophisticated support for python virtual environments (but non-python developers can safely ignore these features).  Smash leverages existing system tab completion setup, apart from variable/keyword completion in python namespaces.  Additionally smash offers features for project management, a flexible plugin architecture that is easy to use, and simple configuration files that try to be as sane as possible.
